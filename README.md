# Antibiosis

Developed with Unreal Engine 5

This is a multiplayer game I'm working on right now.
It is kind of a blend between Lethal Company and Among Us, where you and other players desperately try to get to safety in a space station.
Without oxygen, you'll die, and you need to help each other in order to survive, but be careful : Sometimes, your friends can become parasites, and everything goes to shambles!
